# Treasure Hunt

The treasure.clj program always starts from the top left corner and tries to find a path to the treasure using back tracking method. When there is a path it travers to the target and marks the path with '+' symbol. When there is no path then it uses '!' symbol to mark the path.

1. Map.txt is a supporting file. So always have it along with the treasure.clj file while running.
2. You can create or modify the map using # Walls, - Paths and @ Treasure.
3. The top left corner of the path should always be '-'
